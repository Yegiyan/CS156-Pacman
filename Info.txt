Ghost Behavior: https://gameinternals.com/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior

Blinky (Red Ghost)
    - Tends to chase directly behind Pac-Man
    - Speed increases as fewer dots remain on the board
    - Becomes more aggressive than the others when the number of dots left to eat decreases

Pinky (Pink Ghost)
    - Attempts to position itself in front of Pac-Man by using a 4 tiles offset in front of Pac-Man's current direction
    - The ambush tactic is less effective in the corners

Inky (Cyan Ghost)
    - Movement is influenced by the position of both Pac-Man and Blinky, acting unpredictably
    - His target tile is calculated with a combination of Pac-Man’s position and Blinky’s, making him the most unpredictable of the ghosts

Clyde (Orange Ghost)
    - Exhibits behavior that combines targeting Pac-Man like Blinky and escaping to the bottom left corner of the maze
    - When Clyde is far from Pac-Man, he acts more like Blinky; when close, he tends to wander away towards his home corner
